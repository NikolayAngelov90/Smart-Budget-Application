| **FR44-FR47: UI & Navigation** | ✅ Complete | PASS | Next.js responsive, Chakra UI, Vercel deployment |

**Performance Targets (PRD NFRs):**

| NFR Performance Target | Architecture Support | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Initial page load <2s (3G) | Next.js code splitting, Vercel CDN, SSR | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| Dashboard render <1s | Server-side rendering, SWR caching, skeleton loaders | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| Transaction save <200ms | Optimistic UI, database indexes, minimal latency | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| Chart updates <300ms | React memoization, server aggregation, SWR | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| Search <500ms (10K records) | Database indexes (idx_transactions_date), pagination | ✅ SUPPORTED |

**🚨 CRITICAL DEVIATION: Local-First → Cloud-Native Pivot**

**PRD Specification:**
- FR38: "System stores all user data locally on the user's device (browser storage)"
- FR47: "Application functions offline for transaction entry and viewing cached data"
- "Local-First Approach: Primary data storage on user's device (localStorage/IndexedDB)"
- "Privacy-First Architecture... local-first approach with user-controlled data export"

**Architecture Implementation:**
- **Cloud-Native:** Supabase PostgreSQL (managed cloud database)
- **Authentication Required:** Supabase Auth (email/password + social login)
- **Data Location:** Hosted on Supabase infrastructure (not user device)
- **Offline:** Limited to service worker caching (optional PWA in Phase 2)

**Impact Analysis:**

| Aspect | PRD Intent | Architecture Reality | Impact Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Privacy Model** | User device storage | Cloud with Row Level Security | **CHANGED** - Still private, but not local |
| **Data Ownership** | User-controlled, no server | Supabase-hosted, exportable | **CHANGED** - Export available, data in cloud |
| **Offline Capability** | Full offline CRUD | Limited (caching only) | **DEGRADED** - Requires connection for writes |
| **Account Requirement** | MVP single-user, local | Authentication required | **CHANGED** - Account creation mandatory |

**Justification (Inferred from Architecture):**
- Faster MVP development with managed backend
- Real-time updates across devices (multi-device sync)
- Scalability for future features (collaboration, bank integration)
- Professional authentication with social login
- Row Level Security provides strong privacy guarantees

**Recommendation:** This appears to be an intentional architectural decision. Update PRD Section "Data Architecture" to reflect cloud-native approach OR formally document as accepted deviation with trade-off analysis.

---

## 3. Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Critical Gaps

**GAP-001: Local-First vs Cloud-Native Architecture Mismatch** 🚨 **HIGH SEVERITY - BLOCKING**

**Description:** PRD explicitly specifies local-first data storage (localStorage/IndexedDB), but Architecture implements cloud-native (Supabase PostgreSQL).

**Affected Requirements:**
- FR38: "System stores all user data locally on the user's device (browser storage)"
- FR47: "Application functions offline for transaction entry and viewing cached data"
- PRD Section "Data Architecture - Local-First Approach"
- Core Value Proposition: "Privacy-First Architecture"

**Impact:**
- **User Expectations:** PRD promises local storage and full offline capability
- **Implementation Reality:** Cloud-hosted with limited offline (caching only)
- **Account Requirement:** PRD implied no account needed, Architecture requires authentication
- **Data Privacy:** Still secure (RLS), but hosted vs local

**Resolution Options:**

**Option A: Update PRD to Cloud-Native** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Revise FR38 to "System stores user data securely in cloud database with Row Level Security"
- Revise FR47 to "Application caches data for offline viewing (Phase 2: offline writes)"
- Update "Privacy-First Architecture" section to explain Supabase RLS security model
- Add authentication requirements (FR for login/signup)
- **Effort:** 2-4 hours (documentation only)
- **Benefit:** Aligns PRD with implementation reality, enables multi-device sync

**Option B: Revert Architecture to Local-First**
- Replace Supabase with localStorage/IndexedDB
- Remove authentication requirement
- Implement full offline CRUD
- Build custom sync solution for multi-device (Phase 2)
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks (significant rework)
- **Benefit:** Aligns with original PRD vision
- **Drawback:** Loses managed backend, real-time updates, scalability

**Recommendation:** **Option A** - The cloud-native architecture provides better UX (multi-device sync, real-time updates) while maintaining privacy via RLS. Update PRD to reflect this intentional pivot.

---

**GAP-002: Missing Epic and Story Breakdown** ⚠️ **HIGH SEVERITY - BLOCKING**

**Description:** No epics or user stories exist. Implementation cannot begin without decomposing 47 FRs into implementable units of work.

**Impact:**
- Cannot estimate development effort
- No sprint planning possible
- No clear implementation sequencing
- Dev agents lack concrete tasks with acceptance criteria

**Resolution Required:**
- **Action:** Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-epics-and-stories`
- **Expected Output:** 4-6 epics with 30-50 user stories
- **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (workflow execution)
- **Blocking:** Yes - must complete before sprint planning

---

### 3.2 Medium Severity Gaps

**GAP-003: Missing Authentication Requirements** ⚠️ **MEDIUM SEVERITY**

**Description:** Architecture requires Supabase Auth (email/password + social login), but PRD has zero authentication requirements.

**Missing Specifications:**
- User registration flow (email/password, social login)
- Login/logout UX
- Password reset flow
- Session management (timeout, remember me)
- First-time user onboarding (default categories, tutorial)
- Account settings page

**Impact:**
- Critical missing functionality - cannot implement without UX and requirements
- Authentication is required for app to function (cloud database access)
- User journey incomplete without these flows

**Resolution Required:**
- Create "User Authentication & Onboarding" epic during story breakdown
- Design authentication UX flows (registration, login, reset)
- Add 5-8 stories for authentication implementation
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 week implementation + testing

---

**GAP-004: Error Handling for Network Failures** ⚠️ **MEDIUM SEVERITY**

**Description:** Architecture uses cloud database, but no PRD requirements for handling network failures, API errors, or timeout scenarios.

**Missing Specifications:**
- Retry logic for failed requests
- User messaging for connection errors (toast notifications)
- Fallback behavior when API unreachable
- Loading state patterns for long requests
- Transaction queue for offline saves (if offline support added Phase 2)

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience when network issues occur
- No guidance for dev agents on error handling patterns
- Potential data loss on failed saves

**Resolution Required:**
- Add NFR section for "Error Handling & Network Resilience"
- Create story for error handling patterns implementation
- Define UX patterns for error states (already in UX spec, needs PRD coverage)
- **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days implementation

---

### 3.3 Low Severity Gaps

**GAP-005: Default Categories Seed Data** 🟢 **LOW SEVERITY**

**Description:** Architecture specifies 11 default categories in SQL seed file, but neither PRD nor UX Design specifies which categories are pre-defined.

**Affected Files:**
- Architecture: `supabase/seed.sql` with hardcoded categories:
  - Expenses: Dining, Transport, Entertainment, Utilities, Shopping, Healthcare, Rent
  - Income: Salary, Freelance, Investment, Gift

**Impact:**
- Minor inconsistency - easy to align during implementation
- Risk of UI showing unexpected default categories
- No PRD requirement to validate against

**Resolution Required:**
- Document default category list in PRD or acceptance criteria
- Verify with user during first story implementation
- **Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes (documentation)

---

**GAP-006: AI Insights Cache Strategy** 🟢 **LOW SEVERITY**

**Description:** Architecture specifies 1-hour caching for AI insights, but PRD has no caching requirements.

**Details:**
- Architecture: In-memory cache, 1-hour TTL
- PRD FR37: "System generates at least 3 meaningful insights per month"
- No PRD guidance on cache invalidation, refresh frequency

**Impact:**
- Minimal - caching is an implementation detail
- Could affect FR37 if cache prevents fresh insights on new transactions
- May need cache invalidation on category changes, budget updates

**Resolution Required:**
- Add NFR for insights caching behavior, or
- Document as implementation detail (no PRD change needed)
- Ensure cache invalidation logic in story acceptance criteria
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 hour (documentation)

---

**GAP-007: Data Migration and Backup** 🟢 **LOW SEVERITY (Phase 2)**

**Description:** Architecture stores data in Supabase, but no PRD requirements for backup/restore or data migration.

**Missing Specifications:**
- Automatic backup frequency
- User-initiated backup/download
- Data portability (import from CSV, Mint, YNAB)
- Account deletion with data export (GDPR compliance)

**Impact:**
- Data loss risk without backups
- GDPR compliance concerns (right to data portability, right to be forgotten)
- User lock-in without export capability

**Resolution Required:**
- Add FR for backup/restore (Phase 2)
- Data export already covered (FR39: CSV, FR40: PDF) - sufficient for MVP
- Create Phase 2 story for full backup/migration features
- **Estimated Effort:** Phase 2 (not blocking MVP)

---

## 4. Consistency Issues

### 4.1 Offline Capability Claims

**Issue:** Inconsistent offline capability claims across documents

**Locations:**
- **PRD FR47:** "Application functions offline for transaction entry and viewing cached data" (implies MVP)
- **Architecture:** "Offline capability for transaction entry (service worker caching)" marked as "optional Phase 2"
- **UX Design:** "PWA with offline capability" mentioned in summary, but no detailed offline flows designed

**Analysis:**
- PRD treats offline as MVP requirement
- Architecture treats offline as Phase 2 enhancement
- UX Design doesn't specify offline behavior patterns

**Impact:**
- User expectations misaligned with implementation reality
- Developers may implement without offline support, violating FR47

**Severity:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**

**Resolution:**
- **Option A:** Implement basic offline support in MVP (service worker caching, IndexedDB queue for offline writes)
- **Option B:** Move FR47 to Phase 2, clarify MVP is online-first
- **Recommendation:** Option B - Update PRD to mark FR47 as Phase 2, focus MVP on online experience
- **Effort:** 30 minutes (documentation update)

---

### 4.2 Testing Strategy Fragmentation

**Issue:** Testing requirements scattered across documents without clear Definition of Done

**Locations:**
- **PRD:** No explicit testing requirements beyond "works smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers"
- **Architecture:** "Testing Strategy: Jest + React Testing Library, Cypress/Playwright for E2E"
- **UX Design:** "Testing Strategy: Lighthouse accessibility audit, axe DevTools, manual screen reader testing"

**Analysis:**
- Architecture defines unit/integration/E2E testing approach
- UX defines accessibility testing requirements
- PRD silent on testing coverage expectations
- No Definition of Done criteria (e.g., "80% code coverage", "all E2E flows pass")

**Impact:**
- Ambiguous acceptance criteria for story completion
- Risk of insufficient testing if not clearly defined

**Severity:** 🟢 **LOW**

**Resolution:**
- Create "Testing Standards" story with acceptance criteria:
  - Unit test coverage target (e.g., 70% for services/utils)
  - E2E coverage for critical paths (transaction entry, dashboard, AI insights)
  - Accessibility audit passing (Lighthouse 95+, axe DevTools 0 violations)
- Add Definition of Done to sprint planning workflow
- **Effort:** 2 hours (documentation + story creation)

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Technical Risks

**RISK-001: Supabase Vendor Lock-in** 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK**

**Description:** Entire architecture depends on Supabase (database, auth, real-time). If Supabase pricing changes, service degrades, or product discontinued, significant migration effort required.

**Likelihood:** Low (Supabase well-funded, strong community, YC-backed)
**Impact:** High (2-3 months migration effort)
**Overall Risk:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Abstract Supabase behind service layer (`lib/services/*`) - ✅ Already in architecture
- Use standard PostgreSQL features (minimize Supabase-specific) - ✅ Schema is portable
- Document migration path to self-hosted PostgreSQL + alternative auth
- Monitor Supabase pricing changes and service health
- Budget for Phase 2 evaluation of self-hosting if costs become prohibitive

**Trigger for Action:** Supabase pricing increase >50%, service outages >99.5% uptime

---

**RISK-002: Performance on Large Datasets** 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK**

**Description:** PRD specifies supporting "10,000 transactions" with <500ms search/filter performance, but architecture not tested at this scale.

**Potential Issues:**
- Chart rendering performance with 1+ years of data (1000+ transactions)
- Database query performance without sufficient indexes
- Client-side aggregations bottleneck
- Memory usage for large result sets

**Likelihood:** Medium (users will accumulate data over time)
**Impact:** Medium (degrades UX, requires optimization)
**Overall Risk:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Database indexes already defined in schema:
  - `idx_transactions_date` on (user_id, date DESC)
  - `idx_transactions_category` on (user_id, category_id)
  - `idx_transactions_type` on (user_id, type)
- Server-side aggregation for charts (noted in architecture)
- Pagination for transaction lists (needs implementation)
- Virtual scrolling for long lists (Phase 2)
- Performance testing story in QA epic (load test with 10K records)

**Trigger for Action:** Performance regression detected in testing (>500ms for 10K records)

**Recommended Testing:**
- Seed test database with 10,000 transactions across 2 years
- Run Lighthouse performance audit
- Measure chart rendering time
- Test filter/search responsiveness

---

**RISK-003: AI Insights Quality** 🟢 **LOW RISK**

**Description:** Rule-based AI insights may not be perceived as "intelligent" or useful, risking core value proposition.

**Potential Issues:**
- Generic recommendations not tailored enough
- False positives (flagging normal spending as anomalies)
- Insight fatigue (too many low-value recommendations)
- Users ignore insights after initial novelty

**Likelihood:** Low (rules are well-designed, priority system filters)
**Impact:** Medium (AI insights are core differentiator)
**Overall Risk:** Low

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Architecture defines 4 insight types with specific thresholds:
  1. Spending Increase Detection (>20% month-over-month)
  2. Budget Limit Recommendations (3-month average + 10% buffer)
  3. Unusual Expense Flagging (>2 standard deviations)
  4. Positive Reinforcement (<90% of budget)
- Priority system (1-5) filters low-value insights
- User feedback mechanism (dismiss insights)
- Iteration plan: Start conservative, tune based on user feedback
- Phase 2: Machine learning models for pattern prediction

**Success Metrics:**
- PR FR37: "System generates at least 3 meaningful insights per month"
- User acts on 30%+ of AI recommendations (PRD success criteria)
- Users rate insights as "useful" or "very useful"

**Trigger for Action:** User feedback indicates insights are not helpful (<30% action rate)

---

**RISK-004: Accessibility Compliance** 🟢 **LOW RISK**

**Description:** UX specifies WCAG 2.1 Level A minimum (with AA aspirations), but no formal audit planned before launch.

**Potential Issues:**
- Chakra UI components mostly accessible, but custom components need validation
- Chart accessibility (screen reader alternatives) requires implementation
- Keyboard navigation testing needed
- Color contrast validation for custom theme

**Likelihood:** Low (strong foundation with Chakra UI)
**Impact:** Medium (legal/ethical requirement, user exclusion)
**Overall Risk:** Low

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Chakra UI WCAG 2.1 compliant by default - ✅ Good foundation
- UX Design specifies ARIA patterns for all 8 custom components
- Testing strategy includes:
  - Automated: Lighthouse accessibility audit (target: 95+ score)
  - Automated: axe DevTools for WCAG violations
  - Manual: Keyboard-only navigation testing
  - Manual: Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack)
  - Manual: Color-blind simulation (Color Oracle)
- Accessibility testing story in QA epic

**Success Metrics:**
- Lighthouse accessibility score: 95+
- axe DevTools: 0 critical violations
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 text, 3:1 interactive

**Trigger for Action:** Accessibility audit failure before launch

---

### 5.2 Product Risks

**RISK-005: Multi-Device Sync Expectations** 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK**

**Description:** Cloud architecture enables multi-device sync (same account on phone + desktop), but PRD never mentions this capability. Users may expect it without explicit UX design.

**Potential Issues:**
- Concurrent editing conflicts (same transaction edited on 2 devices simultaneously)
- Real-time sync notification UX not designed (silent updates vs toast notifications)
- Mobile app expectations (PWA vs native app)
- Confusion if sync doesn't work as expected

**Likelihood:** Medium (natural expectation for cloud-based app)
**Impact:** Low (already works via Supabase Realtime, just not explicitly designed)
**Overall Risk:** Low-Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Supabase Realtime provides automatic sync (ADR-004) - ✅ Already works
- SWR revalidation handles stale data automatically
- Document as emergent feature (not explicitly designed, but works)
- Add "Multi-device sync" to Phase 2 feature list with proper UX:
  - Conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins vs merge)
  - Sync status indicators
  - Real-time update notifications
- User education in onboarding (optional)

**Recommendation:** Document current behavior, defer explicit UX design to Phase 2

---

**RISK-006: Local-First Expectations vs Cloud Reality** 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK**

**Description:** If PRD is not updated to reflect cloud-native architecture, users (and stakeholders) may have incorrect expectations about data storage and privacy.

**Potential Issues:**
- Users expect full offline capability (PRD FR47) but get limited caching
- Users expect no account required (PRD implied) but authentication is mandatory
- Users expect data on their device but it's cloud-hosted
- Privacy concerns about cloud storage vs local

**Likelihood:** Medium (if PRD not updated)
**Impact:** Medium (user trust, expectation mismatch)
**Overall Risk:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Primary:** Update PRD to reflect cloud-native architecture (resolves GAP-001)
- Transparent privacy messaging in app (UX update):
  - "Your data is securely stored in the cloud with bank-level encryption"
  - "Access your budget from any device"
  - Clear privacy policy explaining data hosting (Supabase)
- Data export always available (FR39, FR40) - user can download their data
- Row Level Security ensures strong privacy (user data isolated)

**Resolution:** Address GAP-001 immediately to eliminate this risk
