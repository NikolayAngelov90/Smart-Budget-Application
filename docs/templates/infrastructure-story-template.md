[Explain why this infrastructure work is needed. Reference the specific issue:]
- **Retrospective Action Item**: [Link to retro finding if applicable]
- **Tech Debt Source**: [Which epic/story introduced the debt]
- **Impact if Deferred**: [What happens if this work is not done]

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-{Epic}.{N}.1:** [First criterion]
[Checkmark] [Description of what must be true]

- [ ] Run type check, linter, and full test suite
- [ ] Update story status to done

## Dev Notes

- **Problem Solved:** [What technical debt or quality issue does this address]
- **Approach:** [How will the infrastructure improvement be implemented]
- **Risk:** [Any risks or considerations]
